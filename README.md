# SJ2-C Development Environment

An `SJ2` board is used at San Jose State University (SJSU) to teach Embedded Systems' courses. Part of this Git repository also includes development environment for not just an ARM controller, but also support to compile and test software on your host machine such as Windows, Mac etc.

The sample project of the SJ2 board contains code written in C that anyone can understand easily. It was designed to **learn the low level workings of a microcontroller platform with an RTOS**:

Project highlights:

- Fully implemented in C
- Minimalistic design with little to no abstractions
- Follows good coding principles (such as YAGNI and DRY)

Infrastructure highlights:

- Supports Mac, Linux, Windows out of the box
- Version controlled toolchains and other supplementary tools
- No VMs
- No WSL dependency on Windows

## Next Steps

- [Build and Flash Project](Setup-Getting-Started.md) 
- [Read more about SCons](README-SCons.md) to figure out how to build projects

## Build System

We use [SCons](https://scons.org/) as our build platform. The developers of SJ2-C applied experience of diverse set of build systems acquired over many years, and resorted to this one. The candidates were:

- SCons (used at Tesla, and many other companies)
- Bazel (used at Google, Zoox and many other companies)
- Make

SCons discusses the advantages and disadvantages of other existing build systems: [Build System Comparison](https://github.com/SCons/scons/wiki/sconsvsotherbuildtools)

From experience, we can state that `bazel` is really cool, but hard to extend and problematic in Windows. SCons dependencies are tricky, but it is based on python and easy to understand and extend. SCons takes advantage of a Python interpreter making it portable across multiple platforms (Mac, Linux, Windows).

## History

We wanted to build a strong foundational sample project for SJ-2 development board that is used at SJSU.

"SJ2" [original](https://github.com/kammce/SJSU-Dev2) 

The code may appear less fancy, but it is simple to understand and traceable with minimal abstractions. The goal is to avoid designing yet another Arduino platform. There is no such thing as magic in the field of firmware engineering.
